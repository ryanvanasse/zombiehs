# Zombie High School (website)

This is a real basic website I made for the 2010 Minnesota Fringe Festival show "Zombie High School."

It was an A Cappella musical, and we were looking for a pretty basic brochure view. Hence this static site. 

Was hosted on Webfaction for a long time, now moving to Static hosting.
