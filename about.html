   			<p>This musical is set in a time when zombies and humans are trying desperately to coexist. Yet a young human student, Maggie Mulligan, decides to brave all obstacles and become an exchange student at a high school for zombies in order to learn more about their culture. On her first day, something terrible happens! And against all odds, Maggie and her classmates learn lessons they'll never forget. Local a cappella group Late Night Menu takes you on a 100 percent unaccompanied a cappella musical through Maggie's adventures. Our golden pipes will tickle your fancy throughout terrifying zombie fights, delicious zombie-on-human romances, haunting throwbacks to the civil rights movement, and stunning vocal percussion from the infamous Zombie Principal Weathers.</p> 

				<p>Our show would be perfect for the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>zombie-obsessed Minneapolitans</li>
						
						<li>musical theater junkies</li>
						
						<li>a cappella enthusiasts</li>
						
						<li>teenagers, young adults, parents of cast members</li>
						
						<li>horror movie enthusiasts</li>
						
						<li>college students</li
						
						<li>civil rights activists and historians</li>
					</ul>
				<p>The Twin Cities has a huge a cappella scene, and we are excited to bring this type of music to the fringe festival in the form of zombies, one of Minneapolis' famed obsessions. Our overall humorous production has surprising depth through sometimes unintentional but well-meaning references to the civil rights movement, characters full of heart, and song and dance that will set your heart a-flutter.</p> 
				
				<p>We wrote this show for people who can't resist a good musical, and who can't resist a good zombie play. Come one come all.</p>

					<li>twincities.com review<br />Why can't zombies and humans just get along, instead of engaging in all that dead-eyed stalking, flesh-eating and screaming? That's what the members of Twin Cities a cappella group Late Night Menu want to know. They've created a clever little musical that plays around with all of the clichés of teen dramas, but does so with one foot firmly in the street corner doo-wop tradition. Andrew Berkowitz has written some fun music, and the script is a witty one that follows the new (living) girl at school as she deals with rivalries, crushes and survival at George Romero High.
					<br />— Rob Hubbard
					<br />Verdict: WORTH CONSIDERING
